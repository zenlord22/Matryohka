##Count Big O
  Runtime is the same as the number of dolls are the same

##Line up
  Runtime is the same as the number of dolls are the same.
  But of course if you where to have the program input the number of dolls then your runtime will increase with the increase of numbers of dolls to sort and line up from largest to smallest
